The Expense Tracker is a simple but powerful front-end web app where users can:

Record every spending (e.g., food, transport, shopping).

View all expenses in a clean list.

See their total spending and breakdown by category.

Keep data even after refreshing the page (using localStorage).

➡️ Goal: Help people monitor where their money goes in real-time without needing a backend.
